Todo Project

Description:

This project is actually my second attempt at a todo list. Now basded on what I see and read about now a days many people do not like to see todo lists because it is highly 
popular to create especially in the begining. At the same time I wanted to do one because it shows a lot about what you know when it comes to javascript. For this to do project
of mine you just click on add to do and a pop up opens the command center. To where you can name your todo, provide a description of your todo. Then hit submit and it goes to the main page. Once you are done adding the todo click on the x and then you will see your todo. From there you can edit the name and description as you like by clicking on edit. If you wish to mark it complete or delete you have the power to do so.
